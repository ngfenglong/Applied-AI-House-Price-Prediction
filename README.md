# Applied AI House Price Prediction

This repository contains my submission for a school assignment on "Revolutionizing Real Estate: A Machine Learning Approach to Predict House Prices" as part of the ITI103 Essential of Machine Learning module. This project is part of the Specialist Diploma in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Nanyang Polytechnic. 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The project includes data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, performance measurement, and hyperparameter tuning.


## Disclaimer

Please note that this project is primarily for educational purposes and may not fully adhere to industry standards. While it covers key aspects of machine learning and data analysis, a professional implementation in a real-world scenario would likely require additional considerations such as more rigorous data validation, advanced feature engineering, comprehensive model evaluation, deployment strategies, and ongoing maintenance.

Additionally, this project focuses on classical machine learning techniques as covered in the ITI103 module. It does not delve into more advanced topics such as deep learning, neural networks, or other advanced modeling approaches.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is included in this repository. You can find it in the `data` directory:

```
data/house_pricing.csv
data/data_dictionary.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

```
.
├── data
│   ├── house_pricing.csv      # Dataset used for the project
│   └── data_dictionary.txt    # Data dictionary for the dataset
